# ZeroDivisionError Example in Python
This repository demonstrates a simple example of a ZeroDivisionError in Python and its solution.

The `bug.py` file contains code that attempts to divide by zero, which results in the ZeroDivisionError.
The `bugSolution.py` demonstrates how to prevent the error using exception handling. 

The error is a common one and easily fixed by adding a check before the division operation.
